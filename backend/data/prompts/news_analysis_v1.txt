  "event_type": "<one of: earnings, guidance, regulatory, contract, product, accident, macro, rumor, other>",
  "impact_direction": "<one of: bullish, bearish, neutral>",

}}
```

## Guidelines
1. Be objective - do not speculate beyond what the news states
2. "high" confidence = SEC filing, company announcement, or verified regulatory action
3. "medium" confidence = reputable financial media with specific details
4. "low" confidence = rumors, anonymous sources, or vague reports
5. For thesis_relation: does this news support, weaken, or have no bearing on the investment thesis?
6. key_facts should be concrete, verifiable facts from the news (max 3)
7. watch_next should identify the next important date or event for this stock

Output ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or markdown formatting.
